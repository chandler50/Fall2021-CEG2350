SCRIPT USAGE GUIDE 

To use the ./sorting-party argument you place the argument directly after the command: "./sorting-party Arg1[filename]"
The bash script checks to see if the filename given matches a .txt extension
The bash script then sorts the content of the given file and outputs the sorted data to a file called sorted.txt
